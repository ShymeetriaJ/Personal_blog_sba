Project Name: 
Personal Blog Platform

Project Description:
In this Skills-Based Assessment (SBA), I developed an “Interactive Personal Blog Platform” from scratch. This project tested my ability to manipulate the document object model, handle user events, implement form validation, and utilize localStorage for data persistence. The primary focus of this project is on the client-side JavaScript functionality in order to create a dynamic and interactive web application. While the appearance of the application is important, the focus is on the JavaScript functionality. 
The requirements of this project are as follows. The application must be able to create new posts and must include form validation with user-friendly error messages if validation fails. All new posts should be displayed on the page with title and content. These displayed post should include a edit and delete button for dynamic user manipulation. Lastly, all blogs should be saved in local storage and when the page is loaded or refreshed, any posts previously saved in local storage should be retrieved and displayed. 

Instructions for application:
1. Type in the title of the blog post.
2. Type in the the content of your blog.
3. Click the post button to see your post added to the recent posts display list below.
4. If you want to delete the post or edit the post, you have the option.
5. Try refreshing the page and you will see your input will be reloaded to the page.

Project reflection:
As I reflect over my development during this learning process I can say that I did learn alot during this project. This project forced me to become more familiar with concepts that I hadn't applied previously and as I read more documentation more pieces are coming together in the scope of comprehension. It takes me a long time to find the appropriate documentation to address the problem I am trying to fix or address but I am still progressing. I look forward to expanding my comprehension and improving my skill set.
